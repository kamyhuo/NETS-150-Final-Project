Name: 
Philly Restaurant Recommender

Group Members: 
Varun Ramakrishnan & Kamy Huo

Description:
We made a web app that provides recommendations to users that are looking for restaurants in the Philadelphia area. We designed a frontend using React that allows the user to select their desired cuisine (out of 16 options) and their desired price range (as shown on Yelp, $, $$, $$$). After they click submit, we utilize the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve restaurant information and return a list of up to five restaurants, which the user can vote "yes" or "no" on. After this voting process, we display the user's "yes" options in a carousel view.
